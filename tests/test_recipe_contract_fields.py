"""RECIPES.yaml owns the contract fields; core's runtime drops them.

``undo``, ``examplePrompts`` and ``recovery`` are declared by this pack, but
core's ``load_recipe_pack()`` builds a frozen ``RecipeDefinition`` modelling a
fixed field set, so the payload ``recipes__list`` / ``recipes__get`` serve
silently loses them: no error, no warning, and nothing in CI noticed.

This module pins that gap instead of hiding it:

* :func:`test_pack_declares_the_contract_fields` reads RECIPES.yaml directly,
  keeping the pack the source of truth: a regression in the pack fails the
  suite even when core is unavailable.
* :func:`test_core_serves_the_contract_fields` fails while core drops the
  fields. It is marked ``xfail(strict=True)`` so the suite stays green until
  the core-side decision on passing them through is taken, and so the marker
  turns an unexpected pass into a failure the moment core starts serving them
  -- the signal to delete the marker and keep the assertion as a permanent
  contract.

PyYAML and dcc-mcp-core are imported at module scope on purpose: a missing
dependency is a collection error that fails the suite, never a silent skip of
the only check that can see the gap.
