"""Characterize how core loses this pack's contract fields, and trip when it changes.

`undo`, `examplePrompts` and `recovery` are declared by this pack, but core's
`load_recipe_pack()` builds a frozen `RecipeDefinition` modelling a fixed field
set, so the payload `recipes__list` / `recipes__get` serve silently loses them.

Two assertions pin that loss instead of hiding it:

* :func:`test_core_recipe_field_loss_is_characterized` records the exact set of
  fields core loses today, so the loss is judged on every run. It is green while
  the loss is unchanged and turns red the moment core drops another field,
  rewrites a value, or starts passing these through.
* :func:`test_core_serves_the_contract_fields` is the round-trip tripwire. It
  fails while core drops the fields and, being strict, reports as an expected
  failure; the moment core round-trips them it turns red, which is the signal
  to delete the marker.

:func:`test_field_loss_comparator_catches_a_new_drop` guards the comparator the
two assertions share, so neither can pass by comparing nothing.

Neither assertion patches core nor prejudges whether core should pass the fields
through; they only make the loss observable. The pack-side contract itself (undo
enum, prompt and recovery shape) is covered by this repository's recipe tests
and their `NEGATIVE_CASES`. PyYAML and dcc-mcp-core are imported at module
scope: a missing dependency is a collection error, never a silent skip of the
only check that can see the gap.
